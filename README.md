## _printf()
Hello, welcome to our first ALX group Project. This project is about recreating the C library function printf for learning purposes.
The custom _printf() was developed by cohort #17 students Geoffrey Kirui and Anns Rutto.

### _printf() in the C Programming Language
This project is about recreating the C library function printf. The function printf sends formatted output to `stdout` (standard output stream) by formatting the argument(s) passed in and converting the arguments(s) into a character string. This version will be used as `_printf`.

### Environment
Our printf has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04

### Format tags
Format tags implemented in _printf
